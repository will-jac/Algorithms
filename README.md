This is a repo for my Algorithm notes. Like all my notes repos, the easiest way to view them is by downloading zim, a FOSS personal wiki application. As is, the files can be easily viewed (plaintext), and may be periodically converted to html (no promises on how often that will be - if you want them, shoot me a dm on groupme or email at j.williams@ou.edu)
