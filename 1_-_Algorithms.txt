====== 1 - Algorithms ======
Created Tuesday 20 August 2019

* Algorigthms are at the heart of computing
* Algorithms:
	* A sequence of computational (computing) steps that transform **input** into **output**
	* Finite description
	* infinite set of inputs
	* example: sorting
	* Need to prove:
		* Termination: algorithms should stop at some point
		* Correctness
		* Effeciency
		* size of the problem (bit size)

* Computational thinking

* Types of problems		â€” hamming weight
	1. Decision: yes / no
	2. Search problem
	3. Counting problem
	4. Optimization problem

* Areas (course will cover)
	* Computation geometry 		-> Graphics + gaming
	* Numerical algorithm  		-> Applied math
	* Computational number theory	-> Cryptography / security
	* Computer algebra		-> Error correcting code
		* symbolic
	* Graph algorithm		-> Navigation, internet, etc
	* Sorting			-> Database, data mining, etc
	* Learning algorithm		-> A.I


Input -> Algorithm -> Output

			Randomness (sometimes)


1. ?
2. Parallel
3. Randomized
4. Approximation (ie NP-complete, eg TSP)
P != NP
